# XAISuiteBlock

The block-based coding library for XAISuite (github.com/11301858/XAISuite). Powered by Blockly and Node.js.

To run, download this repository through git clone:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/11301858/xaisuiteblock.git
```

Then, navigate to the directory and run the program:

```shell
cd xaisuiteblock
npm run start
```

Note that you must have npm installed.

The purpose of this library is to allow those unfamiliar with Python programming to use the XAISuite python library. A Scratch-like block environment is provided, and the user can generate Python code to use in their projects. 

This is a relatively new XAISuite helper library, so look out for additional features to come!
